<h1>Complete Description of ELP Reading-Play Method for Pre-Nursery and Nursery-1</h1>

<hr>

<h3 style="text-align:center; margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">
    The basis of the method is 1-on-1 flashcard sessions between a “coach” and a child below 42 months old.
</h3>
<dl>
    <dt>Each session is about 3 minutes long:</dt>
    <dd>2 minutes of playing with the child to create a fun mood.</dd>
    <dd>5 seconds to show and speak 5 flashcards (1 second each card)</dd>
    <dd>1 minute of play and celebration to complete the session</dd>
</dl><dl>
    <dt>Two or three sessions per day:</dt>
    <dd>Minimum 1 hour between sessions, based on “spaced repetition” principles.</dd>
    <dd>The coach never bribes a child to do ELP. Instead, sessions are a reward for good behavior!</dd>
    <dd>Choose a moment for the session when both coach and child are in a relaxed, happy mood.</dd>
</dl><dl>
    <dt>Rotation of vocabulary:</dt>
    <dd>On a given day, each session uses the same 5 word-cards.</dd>
    <dd>Between sessions, the cards are shuffled into a random sequence.</dd>
    <dd>Between days, a new card is added and the oldest card removed.</dd>
    <dd>So, the child adds one additional word each day, and each word is included for 5 days.</dd>

<hr>

<h3 style="text-align:center; margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">
Use exciting and well-written word cards for the coach and the child.
</h3>
<dl>
    <dt>Pick exciting vocabulary:</dt>
    <dd>The first words are the child’s favorite words, like family members’ names, favorite foods, and favorite action verbs. Then introduce words that the child knows and hears frequently.</dd>
    <dd>Word-length is not a problem. Both long and short words are appropriate for all stages.</dd>
</dl><dl>
    <dt>Make easy-to-read word cards:</dt>
    <dd>Use A4 printer-paper, landscape orientation, and thick felt-tip markers.</dd>
    <dd>Carefully write the words to almost look like a printed font.</dd>
    <dd><dl>
        <dt style="font-weight:normal;">
            Write words in a size according to eyesight development. Some broad guidelines:
        </dt>
        <dd>• For children ages 6mo-12mo, letters should be about 8cm tall.</dd>
        <dd>• 12mo-24mo: about 4cm tall.</dd>
        <dd>• 2 years and older: 4cm-tall letters if the child is new to ELP. After a few months, 2cm-tall letters are sufficient, according to eyesight.</dd>
    </dl></dd>
</dl>

<hr>

<h3 style="text-align:center; margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">
This leaves a lot of flexibility for the coach. Here are the last few principles of curriculum:
</h3>
<dl>
    <dt>Four stages of ELP: single-word, two-word, full-sentence, and independent-reading.</dt>
    <dd>Single-word cards are the introductory stage of a child in ELP.</dd>
    <dd>Two-word flashcards start after ~50-to-100 words, about 4 months into the program. Examples of two-word cards: “big smile”, “spicy egg”, “running fast”.</dd>
    <dd>After 50 to 100 two-word cards, (~8 months in), use whole-sentence cards.</dd>
    <dd>Finally, independent reading happens naturally. Don't push the child to read, they will surprise you!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
    <dt>Language</dt>
    <dd>The method needs to be in the child's mother-tongue, the language most-used in their home.</dd>
    <dd>In multilingual places, nursery schools often use a business-language like English. Even still, at least the ELP reading-play sessions should be done in the child's native home-language.</dd>
    <dd>A pre-nursery child already reading their first language independently, has a big advantage in learning the second one!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
    <dt>Golden Rule: If it doesn’t feel fun for everyone, stop!</dt>
    <dd>Change to a different activity and try again after an hour or so.</dd>
</dl>
